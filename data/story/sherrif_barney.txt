<Sherlock! What's new?
	>How are you?
		<It's a fine day for a stroll, don't you think?
			>Not really; my wife has been missing for several days.
			>Whatever. Let me know if you see my wife.
	>Can you help me?
		<What do you need?
			>Find the murderer!
				<[tornrag]He's wearing a red coat. I haven't seen that yet.
				<First find out who did it.
			>I'm looking for a weapon.
				<If you're going to take the law into your own hands, I can't help you.
			>I'm wounded. Can you help me?
				<Actually, I never really liked you. Good luck bleeding!
