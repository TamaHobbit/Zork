Henry
<What?
	>Who are you?
		<[introduced]I've told you once, I won't tell you again! Begone peasant!
		<Sir Henry, heir to the throne of England. Begone peasant![introduced]
	>[corpse]You bastard! Murderer!
		<Thou lowly cozener! I defy you to prove that by the blade!
	>I'd like to ask you a few questions.
		<Ask away.
			>How came you by that red cloak?
				<It was bequeathed by my late uncle Northumberland's wife's niece's dog. Why do you ask?
					>[tornrag,wifecorpse]It looks to match this rag I found by my late wife's corpse. Pray tell, how did your cloak tear there?
						<Indeed, my condolances. I came across your young lady in quite a fit. She said a moor was chasing her, and nearly tore my cloak asunder in begging for my help.
							>Whence did she come?
								<I couldn't say. She was in such a mood, running from house to house and banging on doors, I did not mark whither she went nor whence she came.
							>Did she say anything else about this moor?
								<No. Trouble me no further, I must attent to urgent matters of the state.
			>What do you most desire in life?
				<For this conversation to end swiftly. Goodbye.
			>Where is the king?
				<He is gone to Ireland to settle affairs there.
