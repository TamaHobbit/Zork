Henry
<What?
	>Who are you?
		<[introduced]I've told thee once, and shall not repeat it! Begone peasant!
		<Sir Henry, heir to the throne of England. Begone peasant![introduced]
	>You bastard! Murderer!
		<Thou lowly cozener, thou purple-hued malt worm, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot! I defy thee to prove by the blade what thy wretched lips do conjure!
	>I'd like to ask you a few questions.
		<Ask away.
			>How came you by that red cloak?
				<It was bequeathed by my late aunt's nephew's dog. Why do you ask?
					>I'm a curious man by nature.
			>What do you most desire in life?
				<For this conversation to end swiftly. Goodbye.
			>Where is the king?
				<He is gone to Ireland to settle affairs there.
