Brigands waylay a drunk Reginald and take 160d, leaving him bound on the road.
Lady_Barclay chances upon Reginald on the way to the inn, and releases him. Lady Barclay knows Reginald's story is bullshit.
Reginald goes to Constable Barney, who starts searching for 7 men; 3 in green cloaks, 4 in brown, 1 with an eye missing, all with swords and bucklers.
Audrey hears the boys talking about the exploits, and presses Kelsey to atone. He refuses, instead bribing Audrey 60d to say nothing.
Audrey gets drunk at the inn, and talks to Cecil there, who knows Audrey is penniless, and assumes she found a nobleman in need of love.
Cecil wants his name, but gets no information, and asks others if there are any new nobles in town.
Ignatius confides in Aldrich of their crime.
Alfred steals a horse belonging to Ansley_Duke_of_York from the inn. Geoffrey is blamed for not being watchful enough.
Barden goes to Cecil, paying handsomely.
Having told of his adventure, Kelsey and Ignatius follow.
Cecil approaches Sir_Barclay, first offering her services, but upon being turned down, requesting keepquiet-money. Sir_Barclay has her murdered by a servant (Burton).
Cecil's body is dumped by Burton into a river and carried outside of London, where it is found by constable Barney.
Burton is seen leaving Barclay manor with a suspicious bag by Barden, who had followed Cecil there.
Burton leaves bloodied rags somewhere in London. He cleans the murderweapon (a cast-iron skillet) in the river, but flees, leaving the skillet, when Bevis sees him.
